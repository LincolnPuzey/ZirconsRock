### Setting up dev environment
To set up your dev environment you will need to have the following installed:
  * Python 3
  * virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Steps to set up:
  * clone this git repo
  * change into repo `cd CITS3200`
  * set up virtual python and install required libraries with `make virtual-python`

Once set up you can start an interactive python shell that uses the virtual python with

`make ipython`
  
Or you call the main method of main.py with

  `make main`
